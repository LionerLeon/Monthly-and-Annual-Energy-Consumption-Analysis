# Conclusion

In this project, we investigated the general trends and evolution in energy production and consumption in the United States in the past 70 years. Despite the numerous efforts in advertising for renewable energy, our project shows that while the energy production almost tripled over the last 7 decades, the majority of the energy is produced by non-sustainable fossil fuels. It suggests that our pursuit for more efficient and reliable sources of renewable energy is far from reaching the goal. Besides this result, our project also provides insights on the current sources of energy we rely on and the geographical distribution of major production and consumption sources across the United States.

Our project focuses primarily on the energy production and consumption over years and across different sources. Our graphs show that there are other hidden patterns, for example, seasonal cycle in production and consumption, within the energy data that wait to be explored. Further investigation can also aim to focus on factors, like climate or economy, that affect the changes and trends of the rise and fall of different sectors of energy production. Those possible explorations will allow the readers to obtain a better picture of the current and future state of energy produced within the country and the progress toward sustainability.
